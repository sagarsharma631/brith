 *	NOTE : This is a pratice project and by no means this can be used in any production code. I have made this project for the learning
 	
 	purpose and this project is always open for upgradations and modifications. No one is perfect and neither am I, hence I could have 

 	made hell lot of mistakes in this project so if anyone points out an error or performance upgrade(making code more efficient) 

	please contact me at sagarsharma631@gmail.com. I would be glad to merge the code(it it really has a positive impact) and make this

 	project as collaborative as possible. Thank You.


 *      1. There are levels of abstraction within this project, and hence we need to have a number of layers.
 *
 *      2. OUTERMOST LAYER - command manager. This manager handles all the requests from/by the user and makes available different APIs for 
 *
 *      the user.
 *
 *      3. INNERMOST LAYER - data manager - This mangager is the main powerhouse of all and handles the creation, implementations and 
 *
 *      maintainence of all the data structurs and various algorithms.
